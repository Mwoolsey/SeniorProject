# SeniorProject
For my Senior Project I will be implementing a lightweight version of an online banking  
system. The main idea is to capture features that are either missing from current online banking  
applications or are not implemented in a good way. Due to the fact that I am married to a ban  
manager, I will have access to feedback that the community has given her bank on the features that they  
currently have, along with the features that they would like to see. The main features I will be covering  
will include: Digital Funds Transfer (internal and external), Online Bill Pay (utilizing Mint), SMS  
updates, and Account Inquiry/Statements.  

Environment:
* Amazon EC2 instance
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
Development Tools:
* Ruby
* Rails
* Apache
* Bootstrap
* HTML5
* CSS
* Jquery
* Etc.
